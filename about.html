				<h3><span class=heading2>THE STORY</span></h3>
			</header>
			<p class="copyp">You are now entering the city of Belfast, Northern Ireland. It is the autumn of 2040 and on the rain-drenched tarmac streets ancient grudge has broken to new mutiny. In the aftermath of the 2020 Brexit, <em>The Troubles</em> of the past have broken out to surface with gruesome vengeance.</p>
			<p class="copyp">We are carefully moving towards Verona Street, in the very heart of the Catholic neighbourhood of Andersonstown. There, lives the formidable and fearsome Connolly clan, whose names are on the lips of everyone among the ranks of the NOIRA (New Order IRA), and of their Protestant foes alike. On the other side of the river Lagan, which cuts the city in two, the Connollys’ most relentless, sworn enemies reign – the McKenna family, the most influential figures in the reformed UDA.</p>
			<p class="copyp">Their mutual hatred epitomises the sentiment within the city: nearly 2000 people have been killed over the past two decades and many more injured in terrorist attacks. Wide-spread gang violence has stained Belfast’s ebony streets with blood as red as the city’s walls. We are now quietly passing through The Village, slipping by a patrol station of the British army stationed in the city. We finally reach our destination – the south part of the city. South Belfast, historically more affluent and home to the Queen’s University, has become an asylum for students, foreign nationals and all those neutral to the conflict, creating an enclave of relative peace among the other, troubled neighbourhoods.</p>
			<p class="copyp">We now turn into a leafy street near the Holyland area and enter an old, large, Victorian house to join the Halloween party inside. It is here that our protagonists, two young star-crossed lovers, are about to meet for the first time; Róisín of the house Connolly and the young James McKenna are here already. Their unlikely union will shake the foundations of the violent establishment and the story of their love will carry across the city louder than bombs…</p>

				<h4><span class=heading2>ABOUT US</span></h4>
			</header>
			<p class="copyp">The most unique and bold performance of the decade will premiere at the <strong>Waterfront Hall</strong> in <strong>Belfast</strong> and shake the boards of <strong>London Young Vic</strong> and <strong>Dublin Gaiety Theatre</strong> this autumn. Legendary actors, including <strong>Kenneth Branagh</strong> and <strong>Stephen Rea</strong>, will grace the stage alongside young talent from Guildhall School of Music and Drama, Gaiety School of Acting and Identity School of Acting. Multi-award winning choreographer <strong>Drew McOnie</strong> presents this epic story in the language of contemporary, <em>hip-hop</em> style, while the acclaimed modern classical composer <strong>Missy Mazzoli</strong> joins forces the producer <strong>MNEK</strong> with to create a powerful score blurring the lines between classical music and rap and challenge the established order. </p>

			<p class="copyp">This powerfully evocative musical explores the timeless themes of <em>conflict</em>, <em>loyalty</em> and the dichotomy of <em>love</em> and <em>hate</em> in the modern context. Its daring approach inspires reflection and active involvement in positive change. With social development as the core value, the production creators seek to catalyse diversification and widening participation in culture and the arts sector – therefore, the profit from the production will sponsor a range of stipends for young artists from non-standard social and educational backgrounds to pursue their training and launch their career. We believe that in culture all voices should be heard.</p>

				<h2><span class="heading2"><strong>The Troubles in Northern Ireland</strong></span></h2>
			</header>

			<p class="copyp"><strong>Northern Ireland</strong> is an area located on the island of Ireland that constitutes part of the United Kingdom. It encompasses six out of the nine counties of Ulster, historically part of Ireland. This relatively small territory is inhabited by two antagonised communities. Its population of around 2mln is equally divided into the Protestant and the Catholic communities, with the numbers of the latter increasing in recent years. In 1921 the Free State of Ireland was created following the Irish independence rebellion after 800 years of British rule. This, however, happened at the cost of dividing the island, the north-eastern part of which remained within the borders of the United Kingdom. The tensions between the British-identifying Protestants and the Irish, who mostly identified as Catholic, resulted in the most serious and severe conflict in the modern history of western Europe. </p>

			<p class="copyp">The conflict became known as <em>The Troubles</em>. Triggered by a protest in October 1968, this civil war continued to shake the province for 30 years. Throughout the years of violence, over 3600 people died and many more were injured and imprisoned, among with bomb explosions, sniper fire, road blocks and the suspension of civil rights. The Irish minority’s dissatisfaction with poor living conditions and persecution imposed on them within the province led to the rise of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) - a paramilitary organisation responsible for many terrorist attacks on British authorities as well as civilians. Their Protestant counterparts, known as the Ulster Defence Association (USA) and the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), were equally brutal and relentless toward their opponents. The paramilitary activities eventually spread onto the mainland UK in places such as 10 Downing Street and Heathrow Airport. Eventually, a settlement known as the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998, putting an official end to The Troubles.</p>

			<p class="copyp">Today, 20 years after the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland has seen significant development in social initiatives, infrastructure and economy. The youngest generations lean towards the neutral, peaceful outlook on the community and the future of the province. Most of those who still remember the horrors of the times of sectarian violence appreciate the peace above all else and pledge not to repeat the past, eager to move on to a brighter future for themselves and their children.</p>

			<p class="copyp">Nevertheless, Northern Ireland remains divided by prejudice and residual violence - particularly within deprived areas - and the rivers of resentment run deep, preserved in huge murals presenting each side’s versions of the story and their heroes. The shared devolved executive authority has been suspended since January 2017 due to disputes between loyalist and republican parties.</p>

			<p class="copyp">The Northern Irish peace has become even more fragile following the 2016 Brexit referendum, which saw the UK decide to leave the European Union. The majority of Northern Irish residents voted in favour of remaining. Many fear the return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and possible reignition of the domestic conflict in Ulster. Unfortunately, first signs of sectarian violence rising have already been noted, most notably with recent death of the journalist Lyra McKee during a riot in Derry/Londonderry.</p>

			<p class="copyp">If careful consideration is not given to the situation of the UK and Northern Ireland, the six counties are bound to see more violence and deaths in the aftermath of Brexit. <strong>“R | J” musical</strong> explores this very dark perspective and encourages reflection and change in a variety of contexts.</p>
